      <p>Hello, my name is John Padron, better known as "Remer". I was born and raised in San Antonio Texas, and although I bounced from many hobbies indecisively as a kid, there was not a moment in my life I didn't have a hand in drawing. As I grew older, I was exposed to more public forms of art from gallery shows, to pop art, and more importantly murals. As an aspiring creative/ muralist, and another person who is always trying to improve, I wanted to create a space in which there was record of experience I've gained on my own and through others, while pursuing public art, focusing on "Murals". The information I have here won’t be something that should be taken as facts or anything concreate, more of a journal with tips and notes logged from doing murals on my own wishing I had more guidance doing so. in time I hope to create a public section to invite even more input on that guidance.</p>

      <div class="fakeimg2" style="height:500px; width:100%; " align="center"></div>
      <p>In early high school I made my way into the graffiti scene and although it would be many years until I got my opportunity and encouragement to tackle murals, it started with the fire I lit in high school. However, it didn’t come without struggle. The art scene, including the mural scene had small room for introduction, or as an outsider it felt very intimidating and discouraging. Seeking guidance wasn’t something that I even knew where to begin, it wasn’t till years later that I felt I started to earn opportunities. The scene is much different now and there are more spaces and people that have created more inviting communities with art, but even so I know as an outsider, regardless getting your foot in the door can feel intimidating. It’s worth mentioning that there is still a world of things I don’t know about murals, but there are also a handful of things I’ve learned that may or may not be something that can help the next person, so I hope to create a space that can help encourage that drive to want to make large scale art.</p>

      <p>As an artist, I think the need for supportive communities could be more emphasized. The need for informative, encouraging and guiding voices around you helps you stay motivated, eager, and attentive to wanting to progress and thrive in pursuing your goals. All depending on your resources available you may not even have access to the voices needed to help you grow, or you may be missing guidance in a way you feel helpless in finding. The goal here is to start sharing experiences and lessons learned in mural painting and everything leading up to putting images on walls. starting with experiences I’ve had, hopefully leading and lifting other voices willing to chime in and lend a hand in helping. With this effort I hope to create a space where anyone seeking information or advice can feel welcomed and guided.</p>
